# Code Challenge for Reemo

## Goal
Demonstrate your familiarity with Reemo's tech stack and your ability to quickly contribute to an ambitious project.  

## Deliverables
1) Completed project uploaded to a public repo on your GitHub account
2) Discussion and demo to Reemo team members showcasing your project

## Project
Your task is to build a basic web app that displays test Reemo health data that would be viewed by a senior Reemo user or their family members. While you may have seen a prototype of Reemo's current dashboard in an earlier interview, please take full creativity on building out the solution that you think is best.

## Requirements
1) Must be built using Angular 2, specifically Teradata's Covalent UI framework. Covalent also uses Angular Material Design (Angular Material2) and Flexbox. Reference their documentation for how to start a new project. 
2) Data must be from Reemo's test API endpoint. Simply hit this API endpoint to retrieve heart rate, sleep, and step data.
